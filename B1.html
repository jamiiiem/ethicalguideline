    <h1>Section B: Technical Robustness and Safety</h1>
    <p>
        AI chatbots should operate reliably, securely, and ethically, even under unexpected or challenging conditions. This section focuses on building resilient systems that can withstand technical failures, adversarial attacks, and other potential risks while maintaining consistent performance. It emphasises security, safety, adversarial robustness, and fail-safe implementations as the four main goals that need to be achieved in order to ensure that the technical robustness and safety is upheld to a reasonable standard.
    </p>

    <h2>B1 Security</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <p>Developers should implement measures to protect the chatbot from malicious attacks, unauthorised accesses, and other security threats.</p>
    <h3>Techniques:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Encryption: adopt strong encryption methods to protect the chatbot and its data.</li>
        <li>Authentication: implement authentication and authorisation to protect access to the chatbot and its data.</li>
        <li>Threat Modelling: conduct regular threat modelling exercises to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <p>Strong encryption methods such as AES-256 should be used to protect the chatbot and its data. Role-based access control can be used as authorisation methods along with multi-factor authentication.</p>
