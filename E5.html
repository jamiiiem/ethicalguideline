    <h1>Section E: Transparency</h1>
    <p>
        Transparency in an AI chatbot involves being open and clear about how the chatbot operates, the data it uses, and the decisions it makes. It ensures that users understand the chatbot’s functions, limitations, and the processes behind its responses, fostering trust and accountability.
