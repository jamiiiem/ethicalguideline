    <h1>Section C: Responsibility</h1>
    <div class="invisible-container">
        <p>
            The Responsibility section focuses on ensuring that the AI chatbot behaves ethically and responsibly in all interactions, adhering to established principles. Given that responsibility is the overarching principle that guides the development of a chatbot, the other sections of privacy, robustness, accountability, reliability, transparency, and inclusiveness all contribute to the idea of a responsible chatbot, but these goals will be addressed in their respective sections. This section will only highlight unique goals that are specific to fulfilling the idea of responsibility. These goals include adhering to ethical principles, content moderation, user support and feedback, and continuous improvement.
