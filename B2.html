    <h1>Section B: Technical Robustness and Safety</h1>
    <p>
        AI chatbots should operate reliably, securely, and ethically, even under unexpected or challenging conditions. This section focuses on building resilient systems that can withstand technical failures, adversarial attacks, and other potential risks while maintaining consistent performance. It emphasises security, safety, adversarial robustness, and fail-safe implementations as the four main goals that need to be achieved in order to ensure that the technical robustness and safety is upheld to a reasonable standard.
    </p>

    <h1>B2 Safety</h1>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <p>Safety measures should be integrated into the chatbot to protect the user against potential harms.</p>
    <h3>Techniques:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Safety Protocols: enforce safety protocols, such as content filters or content validation, to protect users from harm.</li>
        <li>Real-Time Monitoring: implement systems to monitor the chatbotâ€™s interactions in real-time to promptly detect and respond to safety concerns.</li>
        <li>Safety Education: educate users on how to interact safely with AI chatbots, report safety issues, and ensure their safety is not compromised.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <p>Content filters and content validation can be used to protect the users against potential harm. Safety education can take the form of informative brochures or video clips to teach users on how to interact safely with AI chatbots.</p>
