    <h1>Section A: Privacy and Data Protection</h1>
    <p>
        AI chatbots that deal regularly with educational content should handle them and interact with users with the highest standards of privacy and data security. This section lists the specific goals that need to be achieved in order to ensure that the privacy and data protection is upheld to a reasonable standard. These goals include data anonymisation, data minimisation, informed consent, secure data storage and transmission, user control, compliance with laws, as well as privacy audits.
    </p>

    <h2>A5 User Control</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <p>The user should be provided with the right and choice to control the collection of their data.</p>
    <h3>Techniques:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>User Access: users should possess the right to view, update, or withdraw the types of personal data they consented to be collected.</li>
        <li>Data Deletion: users should possess the right to request the deletion of their data at any time. Such deletion refers to a permanent removal of the user’s private information from all systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <p>
        A user control panel may be opened by clicking a corresponding icon at a visible place on the chatbot’s UI. Within the panel, the user can access, correct, and delete the kinds of personal and private data being collected.
